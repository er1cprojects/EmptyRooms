# EmptyRooms

C++

First project on Github

On this problem, we start from the position (1,1) and we want to get to the (x,y) position, being careful at the obstacles that we are encounting. The code shows how many posibilities do we have to get to the (x,y) position on each element of the matrix, represented by a counter.

INPUT

The dimensions of the matrix
The matrix itself, 0 representing an empty room, otherwise it represents an obstacle NOTE:The positions (1,1) and (x,y) need to be 0 for the program efficency
OUTPUT

On display, you will see the step-by-step backtracking guiding process in the matrix and how many posibilies do we have to get to the (x,y) position NOTE: If the (x,y) position is marked by other digit than 0, the code will display you a message that you need to change the value and is going to close.
After the whole backtracking process, the final matrix will be displayed.
Thanks for the visit!
